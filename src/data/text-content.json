            "As you can see from the website already, I am still only a university student at a highly acclaimed private university called Eduvos. There, I am pursuing my lifelong dream of becoming a Software Engineer by studying for my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology.",
            "My journey began with the programming language of C++, however this year I've switched over to C#, which remains my primary language for everything to do with desktop application development, with java being a minor language used for mobile development tasks. I have also developed a particular interest in database design and enjoys creating efficient data solutions using SQL Server and later on MongoDB.",
            "Outside my coursework, I undertake some other personal hobbies such as video games, hiking and camping. At the same time, I also like to actively work on some personal projects to expand my programming knowledge as you can see in my projects section, where I'm recently learning about web development through the use of Svelte, Javascript, TailwindCSS and more.",
            "I firmly believe in writing clean and maintainable code as I'm constantly seeking to improve my problem-solving skills through practical applications of my learning. In the end, my goal is to develop into a well-rounded software engineer who can contribute meaningfully to challenging projects while continuing to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field."
